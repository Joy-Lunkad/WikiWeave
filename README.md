# WikiWeave
 WikiWeave is a powerful tool for extracting and organizing narrative data from book series into a comprehensive, wiki-style knowledge base..


# Usage
 Add all books in the series to `input_docs`. 
 
 Namespace Template:
 ```
    {SeriesName} - Book {BookNumber} - {BookName} 
 ```
 
 WikiWeave is built to ingest data sequentially, like reading a novel naturally.
 `BookNumber` must be zero-padded.
