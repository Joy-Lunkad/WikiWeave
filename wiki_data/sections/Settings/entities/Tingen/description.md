Tingen is a city located north of the Loen Kingdom, characterized by a unique climate with relatively cool temperatures, even during the summer months. It is a large city, so large in fact that it takes about fifty minutes to walk from Klein Morettiâ€™s apartment to Tingen Technical School.  Tingen has a public horse carriage system that costs a penny a kilometer. 

Tingen has a bustling street life with mobile hawkers selling various goods and street performers entertaining the crowds. The city is also home to a Lettuce and Meat market, a bustling hub of commerce where locals can purchase fresh produce and meats. Adding to the vibrancy of the market is a lively circus, complete with clowns that entertain the visitors, especially the children.

However, Tingen also experiences social issues such as poverty, unemployment, and child exploitation, particularly in its low-income communities.
