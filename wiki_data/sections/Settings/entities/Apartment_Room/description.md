The apartment room is sparsely furnished with a burly wood desk, a dressing mirror, and a cupboard. A single window, often bathed in crimson moonlight at night, provides the only source of natural light. A gas lamp flickers on the wall, casting long shadows across the room, its fuel measured by a nearby gas meter.
