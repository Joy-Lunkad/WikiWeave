The study is furnished with a desk, upon which sits a notebook, books, an ink bottle, a pen, and a revolver. Two doors provide access to the room, and a cabinet with five drawers offers storage space. A grayish-white pipe, connected to a mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings, snakes along one wall. Scattered throughout the study are items resembling coal stoves, soup pots, iron pots, and other kitchen utensils, their purpose a mystery. A dressing mirror, its glass marred by two cracks and its base crafted from simply-patterned wood, stands in a corner. 

The study is illuminated by both a gas lamp and the eerie, crimson glow of a moon hanging full in the window. The moonlight paints everything in shades of red, creating an unsettling and otherworldly atmosphere.
